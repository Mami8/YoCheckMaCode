If you want to get my finished/working projects and libs, download the index.html and HTML directory.
Currently it may be easier to just download it manually but I hope to add many more files.
It's better to get ready for that time

All the files are WIP. Exept the lib files in HTML
All of them have an description on how to use and docstring in functions.

Links are in index.html such as this git profile and my email. 

I created the libs for my own usage but everyone can use it!
If it helps you in any way I am very happy. I am open for any suggestion about my code.
