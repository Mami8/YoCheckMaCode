I reccomend cloning the git repository
If you want to get my finished/working projects and libs, download the index.html and HTML directory
All you need can be accesed with index.html

All the files are WIP. Exept the lib files. 
All of them have an description on how to use and docstring in functions.

My finished projects are in Projects but can be accesses from index.html
My libs can also be found in index.html

Links are in index.html such as this git profile and my email. 

I created the libs for my own usage but everyone can use it!
If it helps you in any way I am very happy.
